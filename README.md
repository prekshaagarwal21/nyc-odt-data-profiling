Data Profiling Tool for NYC's Open Data Team at the Office of Data Analytics

This data profiler uses the Google API to read from an internal google sheet updated regularly by the Open Data team, to profile the datasets listed on that sheet and generate interactive html reports summarizing the key data elements, missing values, data duplication, top values, etc.. This will hopefully serve as a standard tool for the team to profile the data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and complement the teams internal data quality review process.
